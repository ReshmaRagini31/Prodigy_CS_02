# Pixel Manipulation Image Encryptor/Decryptor

This project provides a GUI-based application for encrypting and decrypting images using pixel manipulation techniques. The application uses a simple XOR encryption method to secure image data. It is built with Python and leverages the Tkinter library for a user-friendly interface.

## Features

- Encrypt images with a customizable key using pixel manipulation.
- Decrypt previously encrypted images back to their original form.
- User-friendly graphical interface for easy navigation.
- Supports multiple image formats (PNG, JPEG, BMP).

## Requirements

To run this application, you will need:

- Python 3.x
- The following Python libraries:
  - Pillow
  - NumPy
  - Tkinter (included with most Python installations)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pillow numpy
